  <p>Tech is reshaping how we learn and come together. Software is ubiquitious and
    every person can now build their way to a future that inspires them. However,<strong> Today’s world isn’t designed to work
      for these makers</strong> creating an imbalance between the impact they’re capable of, and what’s expected of them.</p>
  <p>I’m working to solve this problem…</p>
  <ul>
    <li>by creating better tools at Sdui for education and formerly at Hackerbay for hackers and companies;</li>
    <li>by building communities, formerly as co-founder of Hackevents organizing hackathons across Germany,
      now by mentoring at hackathons around the world;</li>
  </ul>
  <p>…and through one commit at a time.</p>
