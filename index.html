  <h2>Hey there, I'm P</h2>
  <p><strong>â€¦and I work for the next generation of makers.</strong></p>
  <p>Tech is reshaping how we learn and come together. Software is ubiquitious and
    every person can now build their way to a future that inspires them. However,<strong> Todayâ€™s world isnâ€™t designed to work
      for these makers</strong> creating an imbalance between the impact theyâ€™re capable of, and whatâ€™s expected of them.</p>
  <p>Iâ€™m working to solve this problemâ€¦</p>
  <ul>
    <li>by creating better tools at Sdui for education and formerly at Hackerbay for hackers and companies;</li>
    <li>by building communities, formerly as co-founder of Hackevents organizing hackathons across Germany,
      now by mentoring at hackathons around the world;</li>
  </ul>
  <p>â€¦and through one commit at a time.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Rule 1</li>
